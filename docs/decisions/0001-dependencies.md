# 0001 Dependencies

Each dependency has one job. Add a line here with its reason when you add a crate.

Runtime:

- `clap`: parses command-line arguments.
- `serde` (feature `derive`): reads and writes typed data, and derives the spec schema structs.
- `serde_json` (feature `float_roundtrip`): reads and writes JSON, the base of the canonical form we hash. The feature makes a 17-digit float read back as the same number, so `verify` does not report a bad hash on an untouched record.
- `toml`: reads study specs, which use TOML.
- `sha2`: computes SHA-256 hashes.
- `hex`: writes hashes as text.
- `ed25519-dalek`: signs records with a local key.
- `getrandom`: draws random bytes for seeds and keys from the operating system.
- `regex`: matches text patterns in checks.

Development:

- `assert_cmd`: runs the built binary in tests.
- `predicates`: states what the binary output must contain.
- `tempfile`: makes scratch folders in tests.

Minimum Rust version: 1.89, for `std::fs::File::lock`.
